## üåü Overview


We introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a 160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16 baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize large-scale model training.

## üöÄ Preparation

### Environment Setup

We support environment setup via **Conda** and **Docker**. Both methods are based on the official setup guide from the [THUDM/slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime) repository. Please follow the instructions in the links below.

---

### Option 1: Conda Setup

*   **Instructions**: Please follow the detailed guide at [**THUDM/slime Conda Build Documentation**](https://github.com/THUDM/slime/blob/main/docs/README.md).

---

### Option 2: Docker Setup

*   **Instructions**: Please refer to the official Docker configuration files and guide at [**THUDM/slime Docker Directory**](https://github.com/THUDM/slime/tree/main/docker).

To clone this repository, please use:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/InfiXAI/InfiR2
```


## ü§ñ Continual Pre-training with FP8

We provide continual pre-training (CPT) scripts with FP8 quantization. Our FP8 training recipe achieves **up to 22% reduction in training time**, **14% decrease in peak memory usage**, and **19% increase in throughput** compared to BF16 baseline, while maintaining performance parity on reasoning benchmarks.

### Available Scripts

We support both 7B and 1.5B models with flexible training configurations:

- **7B Model**
  - Complete Training: [InfiR2_CPT_FP8_7B.sh](scripts/CPT/InfiR2_CPT_FP8_7B.sh) - Full warmup+stable+decay pipeline
  - Decay Only: [InfiR2_CPT_FP8_7B_decay.sh](scripts/CPT/InfiR2_CPT_FP8_7B_decay.sh) - Optional standalone decay phase
- **1.5B Model**
  - Complete Training: [InfiR2_CPT_FP8_1.5B.sh](scripts/CPT/InfiR2_CPT_FP8_1.5B.sh) - Full warmup+stable+decay pipeline
  - Decay Only: [InfiR2_CPT_FP8_1.5B_decay.sh](scripts/CPT/InfiR2_CPT_FP8_1.5B_decay.sh) - Optional standalone decay phase

#### Running

**Option 1: Complete Training Pipeline (Recommended)**

Run the full warmup+stable+decay training in one go:

```bash
bash scripts/CPT/InfiR2_CPT_FP8_7B.sh
```

This single script will complete all three training phases automatically.

**Option 2: Using Standalone Decay Script (Advanced)**

If you want to enter the decay phase from a specific checkpoint in the stable phase:

```bash
# First, identify your stable-phase checkpoint
# Then run the decay script with the checkpoint
bash scripts/CPT/InfiR2_CPT_FP8_7B_decay.sh \
    --load exp/InfiR2_CPT_FP8_7B/checkpoints/iter_0035000
```

For more details, please refer to [Pretrain.md](docs/Pretrain.md)

## üåà Supervised Fine-tuning with FP8

We provide two-stage SFT training scripts with FP8 quantization following [InfiAlign](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05496). The training process uses Ray for distributed execution and supports multi-node training configurations.

- 7B SFT
  - Stage1: [InfiR2_SFT_FP8_7B_stage1.sh](scripts/SFT/InfiR2_SFT_FP8_7B_stage1.sh).
  - Stage2: [InfiR2_SFT_FP8_7B_stage2.sh](scripts/SFT/InfiR2_SFT_FP8_7B_stage2.sh).
- 1.5B SFT
  - Stage1: [InfiR2_SFT_FP8_1.5B_stage1.sh](scripts/SFT/InfiR2_SFT_FP8_1.5B_stage1.sh).
  - Stage2: [InfiR2_SFT_FP8_1.5B_stage2.sh](scripts/SFT/InfiR2_SFT_FP8_1.5B_stage2.sh).

#### Configuration

**Dataset:** Modify the `DATA_DIR` variable to point to your training data:
```bash
DATA_DIR=/path/to/stage1_data
```

**Model Configuration:**
- `HF_CHECKPOINT`: Path to the base model in HuggingFace format (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B)
- `REF_LOAD`: Path to the base model weights in PyTorch distributed format


```bash
HF_CHECKPOINT=/path/to/base_models_hf/qwen2.5-7B/
REF_LOAD=/path/to/base_models_/qwen2.5-7B_torch_dist/
```
#### Running
First, start Ray cluster:
```bash
ray start --head --node-ip-address ${MASTER_ADDR} --num-gpus 8 --disable-usage-stats --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0 --dashboard-port=8265
```

Then launch the training:
```bash
bash scripts/SFT/InfiR2_SFT_FP8_stage1.sh
```

## üéØ Reinforcement Learning with FP8

Our RL training pipeline consists of two stages: first compressing the response length, then expanding it. Before RL training, you need to convert the SFT checkpoint to FP8 E8M0 format for efficient FP8 inference during rollout generation.

### Model Conversion for RL

After completing SFT Stage 2, convert the model to HuggingFace format, then to FP8 E8M0 format:

```bash
# Step 1: Convert PyTorch distributed checkpoint to HuggingFace format
PYTHONPATH=training/Megatron-LM:training/slime python tools/convert_torch_dist_to_hf.py \
    --input-dir /path/to/InfiR2_SFT_FP8_stg2 \
    --output-dir /path/to/InfiR2_SFT_FP8_stg2_hf \
    --origin-hf-dir /path/to/models/Qwen2.5-7B

# Step 2: Convert BF16 HuggingFace model to FP8 E8M0 format
python tools/bf16_cast_fp8.py \
    --input-bf16-hf-path /path/to/InfiR2_SFT_FP8_stg2_hf \
    --output-fp8-hf-path /path/to/InfiR2_SFT_FP8_stg2_hf_e8m0 \
    --force-pow-2-scale True
```

The FP8 E8M0 model will be used for inference during the RL rollout phase, significantly improving generation efficiency.

- Stage 1: [InfiR2_RL_FP8_7B_stage1_4node.sh](scripts/RL/InfiR2_RL_FP8_7B_stage1_4node.sh) with 8K response lengths.
- Stage 2: [InfiR2_RL_FP8_7B_stage2_4node.sh](scripts/RL/InfiR2_RL_FP8_7B_stage2_4node.sh) with 8K response lengths and higher temperature.

#### Configuration

**Dataset:** Set the `DATA_DIR` to your RL training data:
```bash
DATA_DIR=/path/to/data/dapo-math-17k.jsonl
```

**Model Configuration:**
- `HF_CHECKPOINT`: Path to the FP8 E8M0 converted model (for inference)
- `REF_LOAD`: Path to the SFT Stage 2 checkpoint in PyTorch distributed format

```bash
HF_CHECKPOINT=/path/to/InfiR2_SFT_FP8_stg2_hf_e8m0/
REF_LOAD=/path/to/InfiR2_SFT_FP8_stg2/
```

#### Running 
The way to launch RL training is the same as SFT. First start ray and then run the script.

This curriculum-based strategy ensures stable training and optimal performance across different response length requirements.


## üìä Evaluation

We use the open-source [evalscope](https://github.com/modelscope/evalscope) framework for all model evaluations to ensure reproducibility. Our evaluation suite includes four reasoning benchmarks with provided evaluation scripts.

### Environment Setup

We have verified that our models work correctly with the latest version of evalscope, achieving consistent performance results. However, to strictly reproduce the exact evaluation results reported in our paper, please use the following specific version of evalscope:

**Recommended Version for Reproduction:**
- Repository: [evalscope](https://github.com/modelscope/evalscope)
- Branch: `main`
- Pull Request: [Add qwen-code best practice doc #734](https://github.com/modelscope/evalscope/pull/734)

**Installation:**

Follow the official documentation at [https://evalscope.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/get_started/installation.html](https://evalscope.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/get_started/installation.html)

```bash

cd evalscope/
pip install -e .
```

### Evaluation Benchmarks

We provide evaluation scripts for four key reasoning benchmarks:

| Benchmark | Script | Max Tokens | Samples | Temperature |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| AIME 2024 | [aime24_eval.sh](scripts/eval/aime24_eval.sh) | 31,000 | 32 | 0.65 |

### Running Evaluations

Each script uses slurm for job scheduling and SGLang for efficient inference serving. The evaluation pipeline consists of:

1. Starting an SGLang server with the model
2. Running evalscope with the specified benchmark
